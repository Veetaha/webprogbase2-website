# Webprogbase website 'Veetaha'
This is my university web project.
You can check it out [**here**](https://veetaha.herokuapp.com) (you may need to wait for a little while, as the server might be idling and needs to restart once you follow the link).


It is built via `MEAN` stack (`MongoDB, ExpressJS, Angular 7, NodeJS`) with the use of `TypeScript` and `GraphQL`. Feel free to contribute =).
